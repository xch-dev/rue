Rue is a typed programming language which gets compiled to [CLVM](https://chialisp.com/clvm) bytecode. It's designed to be an alternative to [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com) for writing smart coin puzzles on the [Chia blockchain](https://chia.net).

You can learn more about it on the [Rue docs](https://rue-lang.com) website, and play around with the examples on the [Rue Playground](https://play.rue-lang.com).

## Highlights

- **Type Safe:** The compiler will prevent entire classes of errors at compile time by enforcing types are used correctly.

- **Optimized:** Many tricks are used to reduce the size of the generated bytecode as much as possible.

- **Familiar:** Rue provides a simplified Rust-like syntax that will feel more at home for many developers than Chialisp.
