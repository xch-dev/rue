# Rue Lang

Rue is a typed programming language which gets compiled to [CLVM](https://chialisp.com/clvm) bytecode. It's designed to be an alternative to [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com) for writing on-chain code for the [Chia blockchain](https://chia.net).

This is a very experimental compiler, and should not be used in production at this time. Feel free to try the examples though!
