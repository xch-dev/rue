// Test file for Ctrl+Space autocomplete filtering
// 
// TEST 1: Start typing (this already worked)
// - Go to the blank line below and type "sh"
// - Autocomplete should show and filter to sha256, sha256_inline, etc.

export fun test_typing() {
    let x = 
}

// TEST 2: Ctrl+Space then type (this should now work!)
// - Go to the blank line below
// - Press Ctrl+Space (shows all completions)
// - Type "sh" 
// - The list should now filter as you type!

export fun test_ctrl_space() {
    let y = 
}

// You should see the same filtering behavior in both tests now.
