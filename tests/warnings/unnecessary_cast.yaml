diagnostics:
- Unnecessary cast from `42` to `42`, since they are compatible with each other at test:2:5
- Unnecessary cast from `A` to `A`, since they are compatible with each other at test:14:5
- Unnecessary cast from `A` to `Alias`, since they are compatible with each other at test:22:5
- Unnecessary cast from `Alias` to `A`, since they are compatible with each other at test:26:5
